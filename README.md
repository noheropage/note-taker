# Note-Taker
Note Taker is an application that can used to write, save, and delete notes using an Express.js backend. 

## Description
This application combines HTML, CSS, and JS on the front-end with JS, Node, and Express on the back-end to receive input data from the user and store this information for later retrieval or deletion. It is deployed on Heroku. 

Once the user navigates to the notes page they can input the title and body of a note. When both of these fields have input a save button appears in the upper right hand corner. Once a note is saved it is given a unique id and store on the left hand side where the title is displayed. Notes can be accessed with a click. On the right hand side of this note storage area there are trash can icons which will delete the associated note when clicked.
